									<h2>Who is Christian?</h2>
									<p>
										My name is Christian, I was born in 1993 and I am living in Denmark. 
								Currently I study at Aalborg university which is fuelling my passion for every type of digital media.
								This includes both the highly interactive kind (video games, web sites, social media, ect.), 
								the less interactive kind (movies, YouTube videos, ect.), communication through those types of media, 
								face-to-face interactions and a lot of things in between.
								To explain all that I have learned in this segment would take too long. That is why I created this page.<br>
								Besides my studies I like to play video games (I own to different home consoles), I enjoy watching movies, 
								I really like to play Dungeons & Dragons (yes I admit it so stop laughing) and I also use my time as a member of Rotaract.<br>

									<h2>Me as a person</h2>
									<p>
										I am driven by learning new things and at the same time getting better at what I do.<br>
										I see every new thing as a challenge that can be conquered, and it is okay find out that something is not working out. 
										If I am a part of a team, I will always do my part so we can achieve our goals. When I work alone, I strive to deliver the best work as possible. 
										I do that by working methodically and by having a great attention to detail.<br>
										I like to be creative when it comes to solving problems in new ways, coming up with product and project ideas and ceating things like this site.

								<li>
									On my 3. and 5. semester I worked with prototyping tools, such as Axure, Balsamiq and Marvel POP. 
									I used these systems to make prototypes and mockups for different types ICT-tools.<br>

								</li>
								<li>For my 6. semester I will, together with my group, reseach how immersion in video games work.
									We will be looking at on how the multimodality of sound and interaction effect players during a gameing session.
									The focus will be on what means and tools the developers use to keep the players engaged, and if the players achieve the intended experince.
								</li>
								<li>Throughout all the semesters I have learned different variations of communication. <br>
									These types span from face-to-face interactions to different form of mediated communication.

									perceive it in a certain way.
